### (1.2) Compare and contrast the display components of mobile devices.

#### **Types**
- [Liquid crystal display(LCD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display)
	- General
		- Liquid crystal sandwiched between two transparent electrodes(indium tin oxide) deposited on glass substrates for structural support 
		- Polarizing fillters on outside of glass substrates control light passing through, only allow light of specific polarization to pass
		- Liquid crystal layer changes it's orientation with applied electric field, modulating light passing through
		- Sometimes use color filters too
		
	- [Twisted nematic(TN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_nematic_field_effect)
		- Liquid crystals twist 90deg from the top to the bottom of the cell when no voltage applied
		- When voltage applied, crystals untwist, blocking light passage
		- Cells do not require current to flow for operation
		
	- [Vertical alignment(VA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display#Vertical_alignment_%28VA%29)
		- Liquid crystals naturally align vertically to glass substrate
		- Tilt when voltage applied, allowing gray-scale light to pass through
		- Color achieved through polarizers and color filters
		
	- [In-plane Switching(IPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPS_panel)
		- Created to solve viewing-angle from twisted nematic(TN) field effect
		- Layer of liquid crystal sandwiched between two glass surfaces
		- Liquid crystals are aligned parallel to glass substrates
		
		![[lcd-compared.jpg]]
- [Organic light-emitting diode(OLED)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED)
	- Emissive electroluminescent layer is an organic compound film, emits light in response to electric current
	- OLED is situated between two electrodes, at least one of which is transparent
	- Two main families: one employing polymers and one based on small molecules
	- Can be driven with passive-matrix(PMOLED) or active-matrix(AMOLED) control scheme
	- PMOLED - each row and line in the display is controled sequentially one by one
	- AMOLED - uses a thin-film transistor(TFT) backplane to switch individual pixels on/off, allowing for higher res and larger displays
	- LED and OLED difference: 
		- LED based on p-n(*positive-negative*) diode structure
		- LED uses doping(*adding impurities to intrinsic semiconductor to modulate electrical, optical, and structural properties*) to change conductivity of semiconductor in order to create p- and n- regions.
		- LED p-n junction used to convert electrical energy into light efficiently
		- OLED does not use p-n junction structure
		- Doping OLEDs in order to increase radiative efficiency by modifying quant-mechanical optical recombination rate(Basically makes it so that light can be emitted more efficiently/brighter)
			- Doping OLEDs also to determine wavelength of photon emission
		- No backlight, emits it's own light, so deeper black levels, thinner/lighter screens, higher contrast ratio
		- Similar to production of LCDs
		- Vulnerable to image burn-in

#### **Mobile display components**

![[mobile-display-components.png]]
- Top layer is protective glass, newer phones use Gorilla Glass
